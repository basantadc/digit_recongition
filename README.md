# digit_recongition
This repository contains a project focused on classifying handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset and TensorFlow.
utomatically downloaded and loaded using TensorFlow's dataset utilities.

Project Overview
Handwritten digit recognition is a classic problem in the field of machine learning and computer vision. The goal of this project is to accurately classify digits (0-9) from images using a deep learning model implemented with TensorFlow.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset for training and testing.
Model Architecture: Define a neural network architecture using TensorFlow.
Training: Train the model on the MNIST training dataset.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset.
Visualization: Visualize training progress and results using plots and sample predictions.
Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
NumPy
Matplotlib
